Demo of using Google Cloud PubSub with Publish to Topic and Subscribe.   The Python code does both Pub and Subscribe
You will need to set up PubSub in Google's Cloud and generate
a Service Account with PubSub/Publish and PubSub/Subscribe and PubSub/Admin Roles then generate and download a key 
Here I show a demoKey.json that will not work with your PubSub
